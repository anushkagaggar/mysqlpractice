This repository contains my SQL practice queries using a Sales and Products database. It includes basic queries, aggregations, joins, window functions, date operations, and conditional logic to analyze sales data.
📌 Dataset Overview
The database consists of two tables:

sales: Contains sales transactions with details like sale_id, product_id, quantity_sold, sale_date, and total_price.
product: Stores product information such as product_id, product_name, category, and unit_price.
